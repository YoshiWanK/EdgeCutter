# SelectorApp
SelectorApp is a Java-based graphical application for selecting and extracting regions of images that I made for my final project in CS2110. Users can open images, make selections, and save selected regions in PNG format. The app provides multiple selection tools, including point-to-point selection and intelligent scissors for more advanced edge detection.
